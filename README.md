## Concept

With my concept I want to give a picture of all the weapons in the collection that come from japan. I do this by means of an interactive bubble chart in which the size of the bubble shows how many objects there are in each category compared to the other bubbles.

When the visitor selects a bubble, the visitor receives a selection of the weapons that are in it. With this I give the visitor a picture of the use of weapons in japan and the visitor can actually see the weapons.

## Installation

I assume that you have already installed node and npm on your computer. If this is not the case. make sure you do this before you install this project. Select the links below for more information about installing [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

When you have installed node and npm it is time to get the app working. Follow the following steps:

1. Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/MarcKunst/functional-programming.git`
2. Run a development server. In my case I used the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin for VSCode
